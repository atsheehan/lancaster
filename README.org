This is a Rust library for reading Avro files. It is currently in development.

** Functionality

The requirements were gathered from the [[https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.1/spec.html][1.10.1 specification]].

The initial focus will be reading an Avro container file using the writer's schema. We'll need to parse the schema and support deserialization of most types.

*** Parsing schema

- [X] Primitive types
- [X] Maps/arrays
- [X] Fixed/enums
- [ ] Records
- [ ] Unions
- [ ] Self-referential types
- [ ] Namespaces

*** Deserializing types

- [ ] null
- [ ] boolean
- [ ] int
- [ ] long
- [ ] float
- [ ] double
- [ ] bytes
- [ ] string
- [ ] arrays
- [ ] maps
- [ ] fixed
- [ ] enum
- [ ] record
- [ ] union

*** Reading an Avro container file

- [ ] Reading header and metadata
- [ ] Reading data blocks
- [ ] Deflate codec

* Development

[[https://pre-commit.com/#1-install-pre-commit][Install pre-commit]] and run =pre-commit install= to [[https://pre-commit.com/#3-install-the-git-hook-scripts][configure the Git hooks]]. The commit hooks depend on [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt][rustfmt]] and [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy][rust-clippy]] which can be installed with the following commands.
