This is a Rust library for reading Avro files. It is currently in development.

** Functionality

The requirements were gathered from the [[https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.1/spec.html][1.10.1 specification]].

The initial focus will be reading an Avro container file using the writer's schema. We'll need to parse the schema and support deserialization of most types.
